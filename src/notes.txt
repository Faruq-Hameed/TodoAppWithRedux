Here(in src folder), the Redux part is managed
under the action, reducer, and the store folder, but we would need components that
will use them.
Hence, we have two folders here: components, which consists of plain dumb
components, which are the presentational components of the app having no idea that
Redux exists or not in the app. Second, we have smart components that interact with
Redux, and they reside in the containers folder
